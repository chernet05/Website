        <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>   While attending UCSB, asdf asdf I was involved in a lot of quarter long projects in which I served as a group leader. During the process, I was able to make sure we were able to meet deadlines by holding everyone accountable to their task and maximized the potential of everyone in the team through motivations and stern talks. Outside of school, I have about seven years of experience working in retail. During this period, I served in more than five departments within store which included about a year of working as a customer service operator. Working in retail has also taught me valuable lessons such as: how to communicate with coworkers, how to deal with unhappy customers, and how to solve problems on the fly. Before I transferred to UCSB, I was working thirty plus hours while attending junior college full time. This is the type of work ethic I will bring to your organization.   </p>
